Visualized by [Chris Arth](https://twitter.com/chrisarth) and developed by [John Brown](https://twitter.com/thisisjohnbrown), this piece was originally conceived for the show Together at the [Diode Gallery](http://www.jetsoncreative.com/diode/). The piece for that show was controlled by touch data, as seen [here](http://instagram.com/p/rNs9NarovJ/).

Here's how the data from uncontext. was used:

- data.a decides which arc to draw.
- data.b selects the color along the spectrum.
- data.f set how many rings are draw when data.a changes.
- data.d determines both the spacing between the arcs drawn by data.a and data.f and also the speed at which those arcs are drawn.

And what you arrive at is an amazing display of color.
