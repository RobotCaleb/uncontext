<p>When data.a is updated, a new line of circle is initiated, with that number of circles spaced along the y-axis.</p>
<p>The size that the circles grows to is whatever data.b is at the time.</p>
<p>If data.c === 0, the circles expand towards the right. If data.c === 1, then it's left.</p>
<p>data.e.f / data.e.g determines the percentage along the x-axis the line runs along.</p>
<p>Where's data.d? We don't need to use everything, silly.</p>
